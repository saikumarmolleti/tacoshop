                When did tacos first appear in the United States?
              </summary>
              <p>
                The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905.
                Mexican migrants were coming in to work on railroads and other
                jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them. Tacos
                were essentially a street food at this time since they were
                highly portable and cheap.
